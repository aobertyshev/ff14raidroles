def assign_roles(players, roles):
    """
    Assigns roles to players based on their preferences and role capacities.
    If there are more players than available positions, only the best assignments
    (minimizing dissatisfaction) are chosen, and some players remain unassigned.
    
    Parameters:
      players: a dict mapping player names to a list of roles (strings)
               in order of preference (most preferred first).
      roles: a dict mapping role names to the allowed capacity (int) in the group.

    Returns:
      A dict mapping each assigned player to the assigned role.
      (Players who are not selected will not appear in the returned dictionary.)
